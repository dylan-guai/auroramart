---

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Product Performance Dashboard

**Issue:** `FieldError: Cannot resolve keyword 'product' into field`  
**Root Cause:** Incorrect relationship path in database queries  
**Fix:** Changed `'product__orderitem'` to `'products__orderitem'` to match the correct `related_name='products'`  
**Files Modified:**

- `admin_panel/product_views.py` (lines 565-588)

### 2. Category List View

**Issue:** `AttributeError: Cannot find 'subcategory_set'`  
**Root Cause:** Incorrect `prefetch_related` parameter  
**Fix:** Changed `prefetch_related('subcategory_set')` to `prefetch_related('subcategories')`  
**Files Modified:**

- `admin_panel/product_views.py` (line 297)

### 3. Inventory Overview

**Issue:** `FieldError: Cannot resolve keyword 'Out of Stock' into field`  
**Root Cause:** String literals in `Case/When` clauses must use `Value()` wrapper  
**Fix:** Wrapped all string literals with `Value()` and imported required Django components  
**Files Modified:**

- `admin_panel/inventory_views.py` (lines 4, 66-70)

### 4. Stock Adjustments

**Issue 1:** `AttributeError: Cannot find 'orderitem_set'`  
**Root Cause:** Incorrect `related_name` in `prefetch_related`  
**Fix:** Changed `'orderitem_set__product'` to `'order_items__product'`

**Issue 2:** `AttributeError: 'Order' object has no attribute 'id'`  
**Root Cause:** Using `.id` instead of `.pk`  
**Fix:** Changed `order.id` to `order.pk`

**Issue 3:** Missing template  
**Fix:** Created `admin_panel/templates/admin_panel/stock_adjustments.html`

**Files Modified:**

- `admin_panel/inventory_views.py` (lines 151, 156, 164)
- Created: `admin_panel/templates/admin_panel/stock_adjustments.html`

### 5. AI Predictions Dashboard

**Issue 1:** `FieldError: Cannot resolve keyword 'predicted_category' into field`  
**Root Cause:** Using field name instead of foreign key field (`predicted_category_id`)  
**Fix:** Updated all occurrences to use `predicted_category_id`

**Issue 2:** `TemplateSyntaxError: Invalid filter: 'div'` and `'mul'`  
**Root Cause:** Django doesn't have built-in `div` or `mul` template filters  
**Fix:** Calculated percentages and values in the view, added `prediction_coverage` to context

**Files Modified:**

- `admin_panel/customer_views.py` (lines 40, 166, 169, 196-210)
- `admin_panel/templates/admin_panel/ai_predictions_dashboard.html` (lines 47, 60)

### 6. Product Performance Dashboard

**Issue:** `TemplateSyntaxError: Invalid filter: 'mul'` and `'div'`  
**Root Cause:** Custom template filters not available  
**Fix:**

- Calculated `average_order_value` in view
- Replaced dynamic color calculations with Django's `{% cycle %}` tag
  **Files Modified:**
- `admin_panel/product_views.py` (line 650)
- `admin_panel/templates/admin_panel/product_performance_dashboard.html` (lines 103, 307)

### 7. AI Analytics Dashboard

**Issue:** `TemplateSyntaxError: Invalid filter: 'div'`  
**Root Cause:** Missing calculated fields in context  
**Fix:** Added `add_to_cart_rate` calculation to view context

- `admin_panel/templates/admin_panel/ai_recommendations_analytics.html` (line 135)

### 8. Reorder Suggestions
